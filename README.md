# GreedyColoring-Algorithm
The greedy coloring for a given vertex ordering can be computed by an algorithm that runs in linear time.
The algorithm processes the vertices in the given ordering, assigning a color to each one as it is processed. 
The colors may be represented by the numbers 1,2,3,..
and each vertex is given the color with the smallest number that is not already used by one of its neighbors.
